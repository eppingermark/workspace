# Workspace
An online multitool for images and videos

## What is workspace?

Workspace is a simple website made to process images and videos.
What makes workspace is unique that it does not try to have a flashy Ui, rather resorting to a desktop-like experience. Drag your file in, right click to edit it and download.

Workspace tries to be as lightweight as possible, ditching large frameworks. But also wants to be as private as possible. Everything should happen on your device. For this we currently use @imagemagick/magick-wasm.
